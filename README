GNOME Keyring password integration

Firefox stores its passwords internaly, optionally protected by a master password. GNOME has its own password manager called Keyring.
Keyring stores every password in the GNOME system, and protects access by a master password. With this extension you are able to use GNOME Keyring instead of the default Firefox password manager. It allows tighter integration of Firefox inside GNOME.
