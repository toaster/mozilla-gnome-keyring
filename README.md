mozilla-gnome-keyring
=====================

Fork of https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/gnome-keyring-integration/

As of now (2014-03-17) this extension has its own name and version (1.0).
This is because it contains some enhancements regarding the naming of the keyring entries.
It also has its own configuration URL and therefore you have to reconfigure it.
